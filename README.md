# Graph-Neural-Network-Model-for-Text-Classification

This repo contains a simple implementation of the model discussed in [this paper.](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.31.pdf) The paper uses sliding window and considers that as a graph. Another variant of this is also tried out using dependency parsing of the sentences.

This repo is not the complete implementation of the paper with th datasets mentioned in the paper but just the classification model in general to re-use and apply it on different text classification problems.
